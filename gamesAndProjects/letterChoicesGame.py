#5. Complex task:
# Write a program that simulates a simple game of hangman.
# The program should randomly choose a word from a list of words,
# and display the word with underscores in place of the letters.
# The user should then be prompted to guess a letter.
# If the letter is in the word,
# the program should replace the corresponding underscore with the letter.
# If the letter is not in the word,
# the program should subtract a life (the user starts with 5 lives)
# and display the updated state of the player.
# The game should continue until the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
# Use functions to organize your code.
#
# Example input/output:
# Possible words: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# The word is: _ _ _ _ _
# Guess a letter: a
# The word is: a _ _ _ _
# Guess a letter: r
# The word is: a p p _ _
# Guess a letter: p
# The word is: a p p _ _
# Guess a letter: l
# The word is: a p p l _
# Guess a letter: e
# Congratulations, you guessed the word!

# Tip: divide the task into smaller tasks and write a function for each task.
